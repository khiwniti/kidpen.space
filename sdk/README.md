from kidpen import kidpen

async def main():
    mcp_tools = kidpen.MCPTools(
        "http://localhost:4000/mcp/",  # Point to any HTTP MCP server
        "Kidpen",
    )
    await mcp_tools.initialize()

    # Initialize the client
    client = kidpen.Kidpen(api_key="your-api-key")

    # Create an agent
    agent = await client.Agent.create(
        name="My Assistant",
        system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
        mcp_tools=[mcp_tools],
        allowed_tools=["get_wind_direction"],
    )

    # Create a conversation thread
    thread = await client.Thread.create()

    # Run the agent
    run = await agent.run("Hello, how are you?", thread)

    # Stream the response
    stream = await run.get_stream()
    async for chunk in stream:
